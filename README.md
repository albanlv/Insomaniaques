Insomaniaques
=============

Les Insomaniaques is a short story, a fiction, written in French. 

I started it alone and I feel that there are a lot of imperfections. The beginning is too short, some parts are childish, it's overall net very well written. But the general idea is there and I guess it makes a good starting point.

As I don't think I am a good writer, I decided to submit it to the public. 

You can read the whole story [there](http://insomaniaques.tumblr.com).

If you can spot missing points, bad formuIas, areas of improvement, or feel inspired to write a new chapter, submit a pull request.
